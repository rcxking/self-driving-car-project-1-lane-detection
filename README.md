# Udacity Self Driving Car Class Project 1: Lane Detection
This repository holds code and data to perform lane detection on a series of
images and videos.

## Repository Structure and Files
1. P1.ipynb

	This Jupyter Python Notebook contains the code needed to perform lane
	detection.  To run this notebook please use:
   
   ```jupyter
   jupyter notebook P1.ipynb
   ```
   
2. writeup.md

	This file contains my analysis and thought process on writing the code
	to perform lane detection.
	
3. examples/

	This directory contains sample output images and video.
	
4. test_images/ and test_videos/

	These directories contain test images and videos for the lane detection
	pipeline to be tested on.
	
5. test_images_output/ and test_videos_output/

	After running the test images/videos through my pipeline, the resulting
	images and videos with lane lines generated are written to these folders.
   
## Development and Testing
This code was developed and tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 computer with the Python
Anaconda packages.
